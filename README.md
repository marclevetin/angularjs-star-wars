# Galatic Directory

Create a Galactic Directory of people in the Star Wars universe using the Star Wars API (yeah, that's a thing. https://swapi.co/). It should be based on Angular 1.x and use the UI framework of your choice (Bootstrap, Angular Material, etc). You can design the UX interaction and layout however you wish, but the application should meet the following requirements in an intuitive way:
•	Displays a paginated list of people, with some brief details for each.
•	Allows a person to be selected, and displays more detailed information about them.
•	Works well on any device/screen size.
•	Tolerant of errors due to API failure, network lag/timeout, etc.

Also demonstrate:

•	How to make two different angular components communicate/share a single model?
•	Like be able to click an item/object in one pane and be able to edit them on a right panel control.
•	How to handle the async request to the back end and give user feedback that it is working?
•	If two components need the same api model, how do they get it without making two api calls to the back end if they are on the same page?
